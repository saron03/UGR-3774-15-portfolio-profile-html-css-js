                        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was born and grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 
                            Living in this vibrant city has shaped my curiosity and excitement for exploring new things, which led me to pursue a career in software engineering. 
                            I am the eldest of three siblings in our household, which has taught me the importance of responsibility, leadership, and helping others. 
                            These values have influenced my personal and professional growth.

                        <h2>Education</h2>
                        <p>
                            I graduated from the School of Tomorrow for high school, where I developed my interest for programming. 
                            Currently, I am a third-year Software Engineering student at AAiT, Addis Ababa University. 
                            During my time at university, I’ve learned a lot about computer science, web development, and data structures. 
                            My goal is to become a skilled software engineer and solve real-world problems with technology.
